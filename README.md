I used the Xampp server to develop it on my machine!

A social media website where you can create your id, login and then maintain your bio and display pic just like instagram. All the posts from users will be visible in your feed of the profile. you can upload photos and text as a status update!

changes: alot of new features can be added to the project like a dashboard for user and chat functionality or a like system. I have written the features that could be added in the changes.txt file. if you want to add any feature feel free to do it and share it with me!
